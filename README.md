# TicTacToe

Work in progress. 
Building it as a challenge for somewhere I applied for internship.

## INTRODUCTION
This is a text based Tic Tac Toe game in C#.

## INSTRUCTIONS

I have included an _exe_ file which is the latest I have had from my own compiler.

If you're using an IDE, just import files in _TicTacToe_ package and click run.

You can also compile the source using terminal or commandline.

Given that C# compilers act differently using different operating systems, I did compile mine on a mac (there were no errors and no warnings) and using mono, I compiled as follow:

`mcs Tic_Tac_Toe.cs Grid.cs Player.cs IO.cs `

And then ran the program using:

`mono Tic_Tac_Toe.exe `

## etc.

I am aware that C# compilers behave differently on windows, but I'm hoping that it works the same on linux.

Also, for the love of God, don't use visual studio code on mac. It will give you headache. Unless you know tricks about it that I don't in which case please do tell me of this magic!

_à tout à l'heure! :D_
